## End Notes

Please view the [companion video](https://youtu.be/WCYtgVtR628) on YouTube for a bit more information (e.g., tips on displaying search results on a Web page) and "color commentary." ;-)

We've barely scratched the surface of Elasticsearch capabilities in this demo. For example, we haven't covered:

* Tasks API
* Reindex
* Term Vectors
* Routing
* Multi Index, Multi Type Search
* Paging, with From and Size
* Multi-valued Fields
* Script Fields
* Geographic Operations
* Post filter
* Rescoring
* Distributed Search
* Scrolling, Search After
* Inner Hits (parent-join and nested documents)
* Field Collapsing
* [Multi] Search Template
* Suggesters
* Multi Search
* Aggregations
* Index Management & Monitoring
* Cat APIs
* Cluster APIs

And so very much more, really. Despite that, I hope you found this brief demo worthwhile!
