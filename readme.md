# Elasticsearch Introductory Demo

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine - and document oriented database - based on Lucene.

In this introductory demo we will take a brief look at how Elasticsearch can be used as a database, and at some of its unique search and analytics features.

We're using Bonsai hosted Elasticsearch, so we're not going to discuss server setup.
